Given A, an array of people's weights, B, an array of the floors they want to go to, M the number of floors, 
  X the capacity (#) of people in the elevator, and Y the capacity (weight) of people in the elevator,
  write a function that outputs how many stops the elevator will make to take all people.
  Note: The order of people waiting will not change, even if someone from the middle can fit in an elevator earlier
